**Q.1 Write a function called calc_discount that accepts two parameters. The first should be the full price of an item as an integer. The second should be the discount percentage as an integer.
The function should return the price of the item after the discount has been applied. For example, if the price is 50 and the discount is 20, the function should return 40.**
```python
def calc_discount(full_price, discount_percentage):
	discount_price = full_price * (discount_percentage / 100)
	return int(full_price - discount_price)
result = calc_discount(50, 20)
print(result)
```
**Q.2 Create a function called count_vowels that returns the total amount of vowels in a string. (a, e, i, o, u)**
```python
def count_vowels(string):
	no_vowels = 0
	for i in string.lower():
		if i in ('a','e','i','o','u'):
			no_vowels += 1
	return no_vowels
result = count_vowels('example')
print(result)
```
**Q.3 Write a function called double_characters that accepts a string. The function should return a string, with each character in the original string doubled.
If you send the function "now" as a parameter, it should return "nnooww" and if you send "123a!", it should return "112233aa!!"**
```python
def double_characters(string):
	new_string = []
	for i in string:
		new_string.append(str(i)*2)
		string = ''.join(new_string)
	return string
result = double_characters("test")
print(result)
```
